# Kaggle Titanic - Oracle Machine Learning

This is an execution of Kaggle's legendary Titanic ML competition using Oracle Machine Learning (OML). As an Oracle DBA and aspiring Data Scientist, I was intrigued to learn about Oracle's built-in machine learning functionality. While OML does not offer that same level of flexibility as languages like Python or R, it does provide a fair number of ML tools for building models. By testing all the available classification models, I was able to identify the most accurate one. In fact, it scored slightly better than my last entry using Python.

### Prerequisites

Oracle 11.2g Enterprise Edition or higher (the Advanced Analytics option required a license prior to version 19c)
SQL Developer (version 4 or later)
DBA access to make system-level changes (create users, install additional options)

### Installing

(DBA) Enable the Advanced Analytics option

```
chopt enable dm
```

(DBA) Create a schema then create a connection in SQL Developer

```
CREATE USER dmuser IDENTIFIED BY password
DEFAULT TABLESPACE datamining
TEMPORARY TABLESPACE temp
QUOTA UNLIMITED ON datamining;

GRANT CONNECT, RESOURCE TO dmuser;
```

(DBA) Create the Oracle Data Mining Repository using SQL Developer

```
Navigate to View --> Data Miner --> Data Miner Connections
In the pop-up window choose the connection created above
When it completes, the dmuser will have all necessary privileges to create machine learning models
```

## Deployment

Connect to the database as dmuser (I used SQL Plus) and run the script.

```
@OML_titanic.sql
```
